# MERN Authentication Template (JWT)

This is a starter template for a MERN stack application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The backend is built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and [Resend](https://resend.com) (for sending emails). There is also a Postman collection for testing the API. JWTs are stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies. The frontend is built with [React](https://react.dev), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) and [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).

Includes:

- register, login, logout, profile, account verification, password reset
- send emails for account verification and password reset
- get and remove sessions
- frontend forms for login, register, reset password, etc.
- custom react hooks to manage auth state & application data

## API Architecture

The API is built using different layers: routes, controllers, services and models.

- Routes are responsible for handling the incoming requests and forwarding them to the appropriate controller.
- Controllers are responsible for validating the request, calling the appropriate service, and sending back the response.
- Services are responsible for handling the business logic. They interact with the database and any external services. Services may also call other services.
- Models are responsible for interacting with the database. They contain the schema and any model utility methods.

\*\*\* For simple GET or DELETE requests that don't require any business logic, the controller may directly interact with the model.

#### Error Handling

Errors are handled using a custom error handler middleware. The error handler middleware catches all errors that occur in the application and processes them accordingly. Each controller needs to be wrapped with the `errorCatch()` utility function to ensure that any errors that are thrown within the controller are caught and passed on to the error handler middleware.

## Authentication Flow

When a user logs in, the server will generate two JWTs: `AccessToken` and `RefreshToken`. Both JWTs are sent back to the client in secure, HTTP-only cookies. The AccessToken is short-lived (15 minutes) and is passed on EVERY request to authenticate the user. The RefreshToken is long-lived (30 days) and is ONLY sent to the `/refresh` endpoint. This endpoint is used to generate a new AccessToken, which will then be passed on subsequent requests.

The frontend has logic that checks for `401 AccessTokenExpired` errors. When this error occurs, the frontend will send a request to the `/refresh` endpoint to get a new AccessToken. If that returns a 200 (meaning a new AccessToken was issued), then the client will retry the original request. This gives the user a seamless experience without having to log in again. If the `/refresh` endpoint errors, the user will be logged out and redirected to the login page.

## Run Locally

To get started, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. You also need to have MongoDB installed locally ([download here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)), or you can use a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). You will also need to create a [Resend](https://resend.com) account to send emails.

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikitapryymak/mern-auth-jwt.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd mern-auth-jwt
```

Navigate to the backend directory

```bash
cd backend
```

Use the right node version (using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

```bash
nvm use
```

Install Backend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Before running the server, you need to add your ENV variables. Create a `.env` file and use the `sample.env` file as a reference.
For development, you can set the `EMAIL_SENDER` to a random string, since the emails are sent with a resend sandbox account (when running locally).

```bash
cp sample.env .env
# open .env and add your variables
```

Navigate to the frontend directory & install dependencies

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file at the root and add the `VITE_API_URL`. This is the URL of the backend API.

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://api.auth.localhost
```

Navigate to the root directory and run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will spin up the database, api, frontend and caddy containers. You will be able to view the app locally at https://auth.localhost. You must update your hosts file to point `auth.localhost` and `api.auth.localhost` to `127.0.0.1`:

```bash
# open your hosts file (on mac)
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

```bash
# add these 2 lines
127.0.0.1 auth.localhost
127.0.0.1 api.auth.localhost
```

You will also have to add the `root.crt` file from the Local Caddy Authority to your trust store (so your browser will trust the self-signed TLS certificate). First run the container ( `docker compose up` from the root directory). Once running, open the caddy container in Docker desktop, and navigate to the container's file browser. Find the `root.crt` under the path: `/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt`. Download this file to your desktop, then import into your trust store (Keychain app on Mac), then manually trust this certificate. You may need to restart your browser for the changes to take effect.

### Postman Collection

There is a Postman collection in the `backend` directory that you can use to test the API. The `postman.json` contains requests for all the routes in the API. You can [import the JSON directly](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/#import-postman-data) into Postman.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

To build either the frontend or backend, run the following command in the respective directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

To test the compiled API code, run:

```bash
# this runs the compiled code in the dist directory
npm run start
```
